ClientModels will be deritive models of the entity models when inheritance is not feasible...
A good example is the NestedMenuItem class.  It is an abstract derivitive of the MenuItem 
Entity w/o CRUD functionality.  The MenuItem class is a flat table of Hierarchical Data...
We are not easily able to add a collection to an entity so instead we will create a ClientModel
class that will abstract from the class and then we have a POCO class we can easily shape and
are not limited by the Physical entity modeling...
