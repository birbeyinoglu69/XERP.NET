The XERPAllTables.SQL is provided for you running it will produce all of the tables we have defined for up to this point...
In every build I will update the script as we add more tables...
Simply open up SQL Query Window and run it.  It will have some Base Data Records as they were created to ensure data joins 
were administered properly...
